## The New Upcoming Japanese Era

I've very excited to find out the new era name, to be revealed before April, as the current emperor abdicates. This is the first time in my lifetime that we can plan ahead. I'm American, and as friends and allies, I thought maybe we could help Japan with the new name.

Timing: ["Government to present new era name to Emperor and Crown Prince before April 1" (Japan Times, Feb 3, 2019)](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/02/03/national/government-present-new-era-name-emperor-crown-prince-april-1/#.XGnvc5OQHUK)

Rules: ["Predicting Japan’s next era name" (The Monsoon Project, Oct 25, 2018)](https://themonsoonproject.org/2018/10/25/predicting-japans-next-era-name)

List of previous era names: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_era_names

Please note, I'm confident our ideas will be ignored.

Here's my Top 3 suggestions:

* Yuubun - 優文 - Elegant Learning
* Kenkaku - 健鶴 - Healthy Crane
* Mankoku - 漫国 - Land of Manga

Anyone care to add?
