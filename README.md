## The New Upcoming Japanese Era Name - What will it be?

I've very excited to find out the new Japanese era name, to be revealed before April. This is a once-in-a-millenium chance, since Japanese emporers rarely abdicate. This is the first time in my lifetime that we can plan ahead. 

Instead of just waiting, I wanted to help. I'm American, and as good friends and allies, I thought maybe we could offer Japan a suggestion for the new name.

## My Suggestions

Sort of taking all the good information into account and sort of not, here are my Top 3 suggestions:

* Yuubun - 優文 - Elegant Learning
* Kenkaku - 健鶴 - Healthy Crane
* Mankoku - 漫国 - Land of Manga

Anyone care to add? [Do a PR through GitHub](https://github.com/jcasman/new-era), and I'll merge your ideas into this list.

Please note, I'm, ahem, confident our ideas will be ignored.
