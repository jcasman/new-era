## The New Upcoming Japanese Era

I've very excited to find out the new era name, to be revealed before April, as the current emperor abdicates. This is the first time in my lifetime that we can plan ahead. I'm American, and as friends and allies, I thought maybe we could help Japan with the new name.

Timing: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/02/03/national/government-present-new-era-name-emperor-crown-prince-april-1/#.XGnvc5OQHUK

Rules: https://themonsoonproject.org/2018/10/25/predicting-japans-next-era-name/

List of previous era names: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_era_names

Please note, I'm confident our ideas will be ignored.

Here's my Top 3 suggestions:

Yuubun - 優文 - Elegant Learning
Kenkaku - 健鶴 - Healthy Crane
Mankoku - 漫国 - Land of Manga
